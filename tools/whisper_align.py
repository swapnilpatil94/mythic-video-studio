"""Whisper (whisperx) forced-alignment + dead-air-tightening adapter for mythic-video-studio.

Contract: invoked as `whisper_align.py <narration.wav> <segments.json> <output.json>`.

`segments.json` is the `.segments.json` sidecar written by tools/chatterbox_tts.py:
{"segments": [{"beat_id","text","start_seconds","end_seconds"}, ...], "duration_seconds": N}.
Those start/end values are our own generation-time bookkeeping, not a real forced alignment —
this script uses them only as rough per-beat bounds, then runs whisperx's wav2vec2 CTC forced
alignment against the KNOWN script text (not ASR) to get precise word-level timestamps.

Chatterbox's own amplitude-threshold trim (in chatterbox_tts.py) does not catch every gap —
some sentence boundaries still carry 0.5-2s of near-silence (soft breath/room tone that reads as
"loud enough" to a naive threshold but is still dead air to a viewer). Real word-level alignment
finds these precisely, so this script also SPLICES the audio: any inter-word gap wider than a
natural pause (0.35s) is trimmed down to that cap, directly on the actual waveform (not a global
tempo change), and every word timestamp is remapped to match. This only ever removes silence
that isn't between two spoken words — it never touches speech.

Writes `<output.json>`:
{"beats": [{"beat_id", "words": [{"word","start","end","score"}, ...]}, ...]}
and (if any tightening happened) overwrites `<narration.wav>` and its `.segments.json` sidecar
in place with the tightened audio and remapped boundaries, so re-running this script against
already-tightened audio is a no-op (idempotent).

Requires whisperx (already installed in the pyenv 3.12.0 environment on this machine), with the
Hindi wav2vec2 alignment model (theainerd/Wav2Vec2-large-xlsr-hindi) already cached locally.
